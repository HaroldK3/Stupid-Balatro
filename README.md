# Stupid-Balatro
A dumbed down version of the game Balatro using Chase Robert's Deck of Cards API. https://deckofcardsapi.com/

## Issues
-I really struggled setting up this repository to work with vs code. Never done that before.

-I kinda understood what was going on with the API calls, I get what they do and how they work, so that took me like an hour to fully get all of the methods I wanted for this project. All of the API work can be found in the Cards.py file. 

-The hand scoring threw me for a loop, because I didn't get how to check the higher cards like ace, king, queen, and jack, but then I realized I can just keep counting from 10 and treat it all like glorified math equations.
